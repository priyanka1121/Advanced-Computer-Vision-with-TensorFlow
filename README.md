# Advanced Computer Vision with TensorFlow

This repository will serve as a dynamic workspace where I document my weekly learning and assignments for the course.

## Weekly Progress

### Week 1
**Topics Covered:**
- Conceptual overview of:
  - Regional CNN (R-CNN)
  - Fast-RCNN
  - Faster R-CNN
- Retrieved the R-CNN model from TensorFlow Hub and performed object detection.
- Visualized predicted bounding boxes using TensorFlow's object detection API.
- Configured and loaded a ResNet-50 model (not on TensorFlow Hub), restored pre-trained weights, and selected parts of the model for retraining.
- Manually annotated images for object detection using the object detection API.
- Implemented a custom training loop to fine-tune a model.

### Week 2
**Topics Covered:**
- Conceptual overview of popular object detection models:
  - Regional CNN (R-CNN)
  - Fast-RCNN
  - Faster R-CNN
  - ResNet-50
- Retrieved object detection models from TensorFlow Hub and configured them for training.
- Built custom object detection models using transfer learning.
- Trained a model to detect and localize rubber duckies using only 5 training examples.
- Manually labeled images of rubber duckies for object detection.
- Visualized predicted bounding boxes with TensorFlowâ€™s object detection API.
