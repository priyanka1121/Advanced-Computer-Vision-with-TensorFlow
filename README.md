# Advanced Computer Vision with TensorFlow

This repository will serve as a dynamic workspace where I document my weekly learning and assignments for the course.

## Weekly Progress

### Week 1
**Topics Covered:**
- Conceptual overview of:
  - Regional CNN (R-CNN)
  - Fast-RCNN
  - Faster R-CNN
- Retrieved the R-CNN model from TensorFlow Hub and performed object detection.
- Visualized predicted bounding boxes using TensorFlow's object detection API.
- Configured and loaded a ResNet-50 model (not on TensorFlow Hub), restored pre-trained weights, and selected parts of the model for retraining.
- Manually annotated images for object detection using the object detection API.
- Implemented a custom training loop to fine-tune a model.

### Week 2
**Topics Covered:**
- Conceptual overview of popular object detection models:
  - Regional CNN (R-CNN)
  - Fast-RCNN
  - Faster R-CNN
  - ResNet-50
- Retrieved object detection models from TensorFlow Hub and configured them for training.
- Built custom object detection models using transfer learning.
- Trained a model to detect and localize rubber duckies using only 5 training examples.
- Manually labeled images of rubber duckies for object detection.
- Visualized predicted bounding boxes with TensorFlowâ€™s object detection API.

### Week 3
**Topics Covered:**
- Conceptual design of **Fully Convolutional Neural Networks (FCN)** and subsequent models based on them.
- Understanding the **decoder section** of FCNs and its role in feature reconstruction.
- Two upsampling methods:
  - Simple Scaling
  - Transposed Convolutions
- Built both the **encoder and decoder sections** of an FCN.
- Evaluated segmentation models using:
  - **Intersection-over-Union (IoU)**
  - **Dice Score**
- Explored the conceptual design of the **U-Net model**.
- Implemented **U-Net for image segmentation**.
- Used **Mask R-CNN** for instance segmentation.

### Week 4
**Topics Covered:**
- Importance of **model interpretation** in deep learning.
- Calculated **Class Activation Maps (CAMs)** to visualize influential image regions.
- Generated **Saliency Maps** to observe key features affecting model predictions.
- Implemented **Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM)** to highlight critical areas used in predictions.
- Discussed how **visualization techniques** can help refine model design and improve accuracy.
